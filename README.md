# DUDe - Dummy User Directory

## Presentation

The DUDe is an attempt of creating an easy and very simplistic user access management tool.  
It's so simplistic that in fact, it **should not be used** in production. Like never.

I created it to fill a need but also as an intellectual challenge (whatever it means ðŸ˜€).
